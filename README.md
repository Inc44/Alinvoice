Automates batch retrieval of AliExpress order receipts by combining static HTML parsing with GUI-driven browser automation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Scans local HTML datasets of [downloaded feedback pages](https://feedback.aliexpress.com/management/feedbackBuyerList.htm) to extract every order ID without additional AliExpress requests.
- Opens each order in a new browser tab and triggers the built-in "Download receipt/invoice" workflow.
- Handles both February 2025 (one PDF invoice button) and July 2025 (two receipt + PNG download buttons) layouts.
- Image-based element detection via PyAutoGUI (OpenCV backend) with configurable confidence, retries, and delays.
- Gracefully skips missing HTML pages and continues the batch.
- Verifies completeness after the run; lists any missing receipts together with direct order links.
- Requires no AliExpress API keys or logged-in scraping: all actions occur in the normal browser session.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimers

- **Fragile UI Automation**: Button screenshots are tied to current AliExpress styling, scaling, and your display DPI. Any UI change may break detection.

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
conda create -n alinvoice python=3.9 -y # up to 3.11
conda activate alinvoice
git clone https://github.com/Inc44/Alinvoice.git
cd Alinvoice
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üßæ Configuration

Edit the constants at the top of the script if defaults do not match your environment:

- `first_page` / `last_page`: range of local HTML files (`1.html` ‚Ä¶ `n.html`).
- `detection_confidence`: OpenCV template-match confidence for PyAutoGUI (0 ‚Äì 1).
- `initial_wait_seconds`, `retry_wait_seconds`, `max_retries`, `post_click_wait_seconds`: timing parameters.
- `download_invoice_button_image`, `receipt_button_image`, `download_button_image`: reference screenshots (PNG).

## üìñ Usage Examples

### Bulk Invoice Download

```bash
python -m download # or download.old
```

### Verify Completeness

```bash
python -m verify # or verify.old
```

## üéØ Motivation

AliExpress limits invoice retrieval to manual per-order clicks. While manageable for occasional purchases, it becomes untenable for hundreds of orders. Alinvoice removes this bottleneck by automating the process with reproducible local datasets and deterministic image matching.

## üêõ Bugs

Not yet found.

## ‚õî Known Limitations

- Does not retry failed downloads; verification script reports missing receipts for manual follow-up.

## üöß TODO

- [ ] Replace GUI automation with direct authenticated HTTP download to remove display dependencies.
- [ ] Add optional `argparse` interface for non-interactive batch execution in CI environments.
- [ ] Support incremental runs by skipping already downloaded receipts.
- [ ] Implement hash-based image set selection to auto-switch between UI versions.
