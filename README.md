## Original Logic for AliExpress February 2025

1. Loads dataset HTML files numbered from 1 to n.
2. Finds all `<a>` tags with `href` containing `https://trade.aliexpress.com/order_detail.htm`.
3. Extracts the `<a>` tag content ID.
4. Opens a tab with `https://trade.aliexpress.com/order_detail.htm?orderId=` followed by the extracted `<a>` tag content ID.
5. Detects the image `download invoice button.png` on the screen. If not found, starts a function that records the start time and retries until the timeout is reached.
6. Clicks the detected location.
7. Closes the tab.
8. Continues to the next content ID.
